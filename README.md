Health Insurance Premium Prediction Project üöÄ



Overview
This project is a machine learning-based predictive model developed to estimate health insurance premiums based on various customer factors such as age, dependents, gender, and plan type. The model is built using Linear Regression and XGBoost Regressor and has achieved an impressive 98% accuracy. The predictive engine is deployed with a user-friendly Streamlit interface and hosted on the cloud to enable real-time, scalable premium predictions for insurance underwriters.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project was to create a high-accuracy predictive model that:
1. Achieves 97%+ accuracy in estimating health insurance premiums.
2. Provides a user-friendly interface via a Streamlit app for underwriters to input customer details and instantly receive premium predictions.
3. Ensures scalability and secure cloud deployment for ease of use in real-world applications.


Key Features üîç
1. Cutting-edge Machine Learning Algorithms
Linear Regression and XGBoost Regressor were used to train the model.
Achieved 98% accuracy, significantly improving the precision of premium estimates and minimizing guesswork.
2. Interactive UI
A Streamlit-based interface was developed, allowing insurance underwriters to input customer data and obtain real-time premium predictions.
The interface is intuitive, making the process easy, scalable, and highly efficient.
3. Seamless Cloud Deployment
The model is deployed on the cloud to ensure it's accessible from anywhere, allowing Shield Insurance to scale its operations and offer real-time, accurate quotes to its customers.
